# tiptongue

###Natural Language classification personal project.

An app that tries to predict the word on the tip of your tongue based on similar classified sentences from a corpora of open source literature. In development (sadly doesn't work too great)...and please excuse the awful interface, it wasn't the focus of the project.

Description of files:

tongue == Flask app
ling == Python backend
Procfile == Procfile
requirements.txt == requirements file

Everything else apart from js, static, and templates are pickle files used for retrieving info
